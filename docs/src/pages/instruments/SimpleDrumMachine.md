### SimpleDrumMachine

This is a very simple digital drum synthesiser modelled on vintage 80's electronic drum machines. 

It has only 3 voices at present: Kick, Snare and HiHat. Each voice has a single sound with volume controlled by a simple envelope that is set from the note velocity of a musical event.
